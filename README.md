LUA menu scheduler for REDM client by cfx.re

Hello github, this is a working recreation of the REDM "LUA Executor" like Phoenix & Lokishop.

It uses the exact same methods they use which is the LUA Scheduler method, but i have the LUA Menus added into the resources instead of the cloud like other providers.

This is completely free & working!

Warning: This doesn't work on all servers like Syn County & Goldrush but it works on majority of servers! It may causes a global ban or server ban also!
